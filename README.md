# Karbit-V1.0
Thank you for using Karbit! We hope you find Karbit to be a useful currency to propel society into the future, just as we do. 
This version of Karbit is the first one! So, naturally, it's a work-in-progress. If you've read the whitepaper, you'll know that new versions will be coming out every few weeks, so there's no rush to start gathering Karbits now. However, if you want to have a better opportunity to recover from a crash, we recommend you join as soon as possible.
Thanks again!
